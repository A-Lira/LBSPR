Package: LBSPR
Title: Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Adrian", "Hordyk", email = "ar.hordyk@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Simulate expected equilibrium length composition, YPR, and
    SPR using the LBSPR model. Fit the LBSPR model to length data to estimate
    selectivity, relative fishing mortality, and spawning potential ratio for 
	data-limited fisheries.
