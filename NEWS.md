# LBSPR 0.1.9003

## Minor Changes
- Shiny applications have now been added to the package. Launch the applications using the `Shiny` function: e.g., `Shiny("LBSPR")` or `Shiny("Sim")`
- the relative spawning stock biomass (SSB) is now calculated and reported in the simulation model
- modified the plotSim function so that it now produces several plots including SSB/SSB0 to yield and spr plot 
- split functions in functions.r into separate r files
- updated the vignette

## Bug Fixes
- added packages required by the Shiny applications as dependencies
